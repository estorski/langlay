# Langlay
A small & simple tool for switching current input language with a custom hotkey, for Windows.

The tool just hangs somewhere in your RAM (and is rather small btw), and monitors your keystrokes.
Whenever you press your custom keystroke (Caps Lock by default), it just changes the current system language to the next one in the queue of currently installed languages (or keyboard layouts if you set it up for it).

Note, changing input language and changing keyboard layout - are different actions for this tool. And you are free to customize the most preferable way of working with all these matters.
